# 
# ### Dataset Description 
# 
# ### What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
# 
# information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
# Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full yearâ€™s coverage is desired.
# Here are the datasets in CSV format. You can fit your model using the train data, then predict using the test data and submit your predictions in the format of the sample submission.
# Your goal is to predict the rotor bearing temperature, which is the Target column in the datasets.

# ### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
# 
# I'm most interested in figuring out .

# what features are best for predicting most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year?

# How long does the average trip take?

# Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?.

# ### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
# 
# When investigating the x, y, and z size variables, a number of outlier points were identified. Overall, these points can be characterized by an inconsistency between the recorded value of depth, and the value that would be derived from using x, y, and z. For safety, all of these points were removed from the dataset to move forwards.

# ## Bivariate Exploration
# 
# To start off with, I want to look at the pairwise correlations present between features in the data.

# ## Multivariate Exploration
# any interesting relationships between the other features not the main feature(s) of interest

# #### Faceting for Multivariate Data
# you saw how FacetGrid could be used to subset your dataset across levels of a categorical variable, and then create one plot for each subset. Where the faceted plots demonstrated were univariate before, you can actually use any plot type, allowing you to facet bivariate plots to create a multivariate visualization.

# The faceted box plot suggests a slight interaction between the two categorical variables, where, in level B of "member_gender", the level of "user_type" seems to be have a larger effect on the value of "bike_id", compared to the trend within "member_gender" level A.

# In[63]:


g = sns.FacetGrid(data = df_go_bike, col = 'member_gender', size = 6)
g.map(sns.boxplot, 'user_type', 'bike_id')
